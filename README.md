# compclasses

Like *dataclasses*, but for composition.

As the Gang of Four (probably) said:

> favor object composition over class inheritance.

However when we use composition in Python, we cannot access methods directly from the composed class.

This codebase wants to address such issue and make it easy to do so, by injecting the desired methods in the new class.

## Alpha Notice

This codebase is experimental and is working for my use cases. It is very probable that there are cases not covered and for which everything breaks. If you find them, please feel free to open an issue in the [issue page](https://github.com/FBruzzesi/compclasses/issues) of the repo.
